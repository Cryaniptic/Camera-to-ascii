# Camera-to-ascii
A small bit of code to convert camera input into terminal ascii using python.  

Required libraries:  
- nCurses (for terminal display)  
- numpy  
- OpenCV (for camera and image processing)  

To run correctly, the program needs to be run through terminal (run `python Ascii_from_camera.py` in the directory of the file).  
Currently only tested on Windows cmd although should work on other terminals.  
Theres some options that can be changed at the top of the code aswell.
